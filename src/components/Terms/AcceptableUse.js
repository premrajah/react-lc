                            Where we do provide any interactive service, we will provide clear
                            information to you about the kind of service offered, if it is moderated
                            and what form of moderation is used (including whether it is human or
                            technical).

                            We will do our best to assess any possible risks for users (and in
                            particular, for children) from third parties when they use any interactive
                            service provided on our site, and we will decide in each case whether it is
                            appropriate to use moderation of the relevant service (including what kind
                            of moderation to use) in the light of those risks. However, we are under no
                            obligation to oversee, monitor or moderate any interactive service we
                            provide on our site, and we expressly exclude our liability for any loss or
                            damage arising from the use of any interactive service by a user in
                            contravention of our content standards, whether the service is moderated or
                            not.

                            The use of any of our interactive services by a minor is subject to the
                            consent of their parent or guardian. We advise parents who permit their
                            children to use an interactive service that it is important that they
                            communicate with their children about their safety online, as moderation is
                            not fool proof. Minors who are using any interactive service should be made
                            aware of the potential risks to them.

                            arise.
